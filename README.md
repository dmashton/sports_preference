### Project Title
Postgres DVD Rental Preferences Project

### Description
This is a query on a relational database of a DVD rental business. A prior query showed that according to this database, customers with an address in India preferred sports as their 2nd most rented category.  This query attempts to answer the question of which kind of sports Indians prefer by analyzing the keywords found in the film descriptive text and providing breakdown data for a pie chart visual. Note: the database was randomly generated so the results are not the point, rather the coding techniques used to answer the question posed is the main point of interest.
